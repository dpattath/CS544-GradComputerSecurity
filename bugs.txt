[http.c:94]
we can put too much information inside of the HTTP Request and
overflow through the env, we are taking advantage of sprintf's

    envp += sprintf(envp, "REQUEST_METHOD=%s", buf) + 1;
    envp += sprintf(envp, "SERVER_PROTOCOL=%s", sp2) + 1;

[http.c:105]
if we have a long requested path, we can overflow reqpath based

    url_decode(reqpath, sp1);

[http.c:159]
we can use the same url_decode in the HTTP header parsing and take
the header value to overflow the "value" array into RA's

    url_decode(value, sp);

[http.c:165]
we can use the sprintf in http header parsing to overflow the envvar
array into the RA's

    sprintf(envvar, "HTTP_%s", buf);

[http.c:282]
if we have a long request URI, we can use the "name" argument of 
http_serve to overwrite the handler pointer or overflow pn

    void (*handler)(int, const char *) = http_serve_none;
    char pn[1024];
    strcat(pn, name);
    handler(fd, pn);

[zookd.c:118]
if we had a way to change the envvar, we can use the previous vuln

    http_serve(fd, getenv("REQUEST_URI"));
